This is a project where I used Python and a guide from Stanford to create a "miniature AI" of sorts. I gathered texts in a file and have the program print out some song starters, phrases or lyrics of a poem from which to gather ideas to make a new song/poem. When run, this program creates a tkinter graphic of the lines.
